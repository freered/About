# About
Freered is about community freedom to explore and expand on the official Red repo. You will find all information about the great Red programming language starting on the official homepage http://www.red-lang.org We are very sure that you will come to like it very much.

# Because
We love Red. And we like to explore the possibilities and expand functionality beyond what the current Red project can offer.

# Community
That is us all.
I believe there are skilled programmers and computer experts in the world today that will love a challenge and get to (re)learn (some forgotten) knowledge. 

Red is not programmed in C nor in C#. Red is being developed in Rebol and in Red (Red/System) itself. For a skilled programmer that is the first minor challenge, but easily overcome. Next up there are many real challenges to face.

The need for
    Garbage Collection
    64-bit support
    View support for platform Linux 
    View support for platform FreeBSD (imagine FreeRed running fully on FreeBSD ;-) )
    Full I/O
    Port support
are just a few I quickly can summarize by heart.

# Realistic?
Is is realistic some of these goals will be realized? Perhaps it is not. Perhaps none of them will be completed here.
It depends on the number of developers helping and on the level of cooperation reached. Having a place on neutral ground 
makes it possible to work together beyond what is possible using our own repositories and forks.
The solutions that come up here may also be not like anything the official Red team envisions and will eventually create. 
Whatever the result, there will certainly be valuable lessons to be learned. As there will be a lot of documentation on various computing subjects collected and made available, together with all the development done on the topics, I think it will be an experience that deepens the knowledge you may already have and that alone could be worth it.

# Hostile Fork??
Certainly not! Competing at most.
The subjects listed above also are not competing directly with the plans of the official Red development team that develops the `real` thing.
Perhaps some of the work done here can eventually become part of the original work. But they will have to beg, steal or borrow to get it ;-)
That is why the license is equal to the license of the original project.

# Where do I start?
I don't know. Many of the things that can use expansion are not in my direct know-how. So that will be up to you.
The guideline for changes to be accepted is, stay in line with existing code follow the guidelines for contributing to the real project add testcases, do the testing. It will be less strict as the original project, but you must convince the maintainer that you did the right thing. (And some discussion can follow). Besides that I am not going to struggle about 4/6/8 spaces or a tab, and when some things are not in line with regulation I hope I or someone else will find some time to guide you through.

# When do I start?
Didn't you already? Now off course!

Best regards,

Arnold van Hofwegen
